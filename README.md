## 📊 Usage Guide

Now that you have installed the application, let’s see how to use it effectively.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Data

You need two double-precision floating-point strided arrays. If you don’t have data ready, you can create sample data using a simple spreadsheet or text editor.

### Step 2: Import the Arrays

1. Open the application.
2. Look for a button or section labeled "Import Arrays."
3. Choose the file containing your arrays.
4. Confirm the format as double-precision, if prompted.

### Step 3: Compute the Residuals

1. Once your arrays are imported, look for the "Compute" button.
2. Click "Compute" to begin the calculation.
3. The results will display on the screen, showing the residual sum of squares.

### Step 4: Save or Export Results

1. You can save your results to a file by clicking the "Save" or "Export" button.
2. Choose your desired format (e.g., CSV, TXT) and location.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Easy Setup:** Install the application quickly, with straightforward steps for all operating systems.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The design allows anyone to navigate easily.
- **Fast Computation:** The application computes the residual sum of squares efficiently for large datasets.
- **Supports Strided Arrays:** Handle arrays that are not contiguous in memory but still take advantage of efficient calculations.
- **Export Options:** Save your results in multiple formats for further use.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while using the application, consider the following tips:

- **Installation Errors:** Ensure that you have the correct file for your operating system. Check system requirements and permissions if problems persist.
- **Data Import Issues:** Verify that your data format matches what the application accepts. Double-check for any errors in your data file.
- **Computation Errors:** If the computation does not yield expected results, ensure that both arrays are of the same length and double-precision.
